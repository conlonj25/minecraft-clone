# Minecraft Clone

Minecraft Clone is a website I created for DCU module [EE497](https://www101.dcu.ie/registry/module_contents_no_mod.php?function=2&subcode=EE497) - 3D Interface Technologies.

The website is an attempt at a browser-based clone of popular PC game Minecraft. It is intended for entirely for academic use. In it, the user can load a basic scene of destructible voxels, navigate around the scene and destroy voxels by clicking on them. All objects are constructed from scratch in Javascript using OpenSceneGraph ([Robert Sadleir's](https://www.dcu.ie/electronics/people/robert-sadleir) custom implementation of the [OSG.js
WebGL framework](https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs)).

Written almost entirely in Javascript. It requires nothing more than a web browser to run. Try it on your phone!
